# :wave: Hello!
shell-examples is a collection of customizable templates for your PowerShell. 
To open PowerShell, type on your task bar on the search button "PowerShell" and a terminal-like application will open. That's where you can run commands in the Shell scripting language!
# ‚ùìContributions
If you want to contribute, you can create your own branch and a pull request (for contributors), or you can send an issue explaining the code and the Shell's functions.
Happy scripting! :)
